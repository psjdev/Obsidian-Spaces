/**
 * The only module that WRITES to Obsidian's explorer tree.
 *
 * It is not the only module that KNOWS that DOM — `DragOrdering` reads and
 * hit-tests the same tree, and `main.ts` reads it through the sort seam. What
 * is exclusive is the writing: owned classes go on rows from here and nowhere
 * else. Selector strings stay centralised in `selectors.ts` for every reader.
 *
 * Two measured facts drive the design:
 *  - data-path is on .tree-item-self, but the row container is its parent
 *    .tree-item. Classing the wrong one leaves folder children visible.
 *  - The tree is WINDOWED: rows detach when scrolled out of view and
 *    reattach later, so application must run on row insertion too.
 *
 * SEVERAL containers, not one. There is one active selection per app
 * instance, and it applies to every file-explorer leaf in the main window.
 * Obsidian permits more than one — drag the Files tab into a split — and one
 * binding leaves the second pane rendered unclassed. One snapshot still,
 * because there is one selection; N containers to write it into.
